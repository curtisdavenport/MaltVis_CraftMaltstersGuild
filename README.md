# MaltVis_CraftMaltstersGuild
MaltVis is a web-based tool Andrew Caffrey and Curtis Davenport developed together at Admiral to help maltsters engage with their process and malt analysis data, and use that data to produce better malt. The tool was introduced during the 2021 Craft Malt Conference and is now ready for Guild members to use as well! 

MaltVis allows maltsters to upload their process data and lab analysis results to view trends, explore correlations between process data and lab results, and perform basic statistical analysis on lab results.

With a steady stream of data being collected throughout the malting process and from 3rd party analysis, we wanted to create an accessible, user-friendly tool to regularly visualize and analyze that data. Viewing data in context, as a trend, is more informative than simply reviewing individual data points and can help in noticing issues, identifying the causes, and testing corrective actions. As maltsters, most of us probably already have a pretty good grasp on how our raw materials and process behave and how that impacts malt quality. Using MaltVis can help affirm (or challenge) and quantify that intuition.

Have ideas for how the tool could be improved? Feel free to report an Issue or contribute code of your own.
